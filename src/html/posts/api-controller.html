  <div class="panel-body">
    Recently I built a sample REST API using the Lumen micro framework by Laravel. The API was required
    to allow users to track cities they have visited from a provided list, as well as display the cities
    each user has visited. This snippet comes from the UsersController.
    <pre>
<code class="language-php">/**
 * GET /user/{user_id}/visits
 *
 * Returns a list of cities the user has visited.
 * The state name gets appended because I imagine it will be
 * commonly requested data. Better to do the join now than run
 * another SELECT later.
 *
 * Funfact: Mutators don't run on related models in laravel
 * thus we can't simply do $Users->cities()->paginate().
 *
 * @param $user_id
 * @return Response
 */
 public function listVisitedCitiesAction ($user_id):Response
 {

  $user = User::find($user_id);

  if (!$user)
  {
    return $this->jsonResponse(false, "User not found.", 404);
  }

  $cities = \DB::table('users')
    ->join('user_city', 'user_id', '=', 'id')
    ->join('cities', 'cities.id' ,'=', 'user_city.city_id')
    ->join('states', 'cities.state_id', '=', 'states.id')
    ->where('users.id', '=', $user->id)
    ->select(
    \DB::raw("
      cities.id,
      cities.name AS name,
      cities.state_id,
      states.name AS state_name,
      " . City::LAT_LONG_SQL)
    )
    ->paginate(50);

  if (count($cities))
  {
    return $this->jsonResponse(true, "Cities visited", 200, $cities, true);
  }
  else
  {
    return $this->jsonResponse(false, "No visits recorded.", 200);
  }

}</code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      The desired output from this endpoint required a custom written query as opposed to simply utilizing Laravel's
      object relationship mapping utility. <code class="language-php">City::LAT_LONG_SQL</code> is a
      <code class="language-sql">SELECT</code> statement tied to the City model used to convert the cities tables'
      "location" field (which is stored as a <code class="language-sql">POINT</code>) into separate latitude and
      longitude fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code class="language-php">$this->jsonResponse()</code> is a custom method inherited by all controller classes
      that I wrote to standardize the API's output format across endpoints.
