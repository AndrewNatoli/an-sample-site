      One of the many websites I worked on while at Desktop Solutions was
      <a href="https://github.com/CodeForCharlotte/cmpd-winter-gift" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
        our own!
      </a>
      Our site is powered with WordPress and while we <em>did</em> start with a base template,
      I worked with our designer to overhaul its look and lay out our content.
